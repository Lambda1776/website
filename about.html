<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Im just your average teen living in what could be considered europe/asia.
I consoome social media, I like music, good psychology books, spicy memes,
I dislike consumerism and the bad consequences of the Industrial revolution,
and I dont like normies.
<h1>Music tastes</h1>
<p>I recently decided to pick up guitar for some reason, and thus my 
music taste has developed enough to the point where I could legitematly pass it`
off as a personality definig trait. Ive recently taken a liking
for bands like Royal blood, Racer X, mr big, people like buckethead, bands like tool(even
though at times their music is bland, and they are proponents of the cringe
grunge emo scene, and are bill hicks enjoyers, which are all things I personally
dislike about them.) Still, through some unknown reason I have managed to 
connect with the band to the point I actually bought their tshirt (consumerism
at its finest)</p>
<h1>Psychology interest</h1>
<p>I've recently begun to explore psychology. This happend, almost ironically
by something as "unimportant" as memes. I have been lucky enough to stumble upon
a "YouTube" channel which goes by the name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb4pvsyqNrmBIGJFQxEukUA">Meme Analysis.</a>In which, the owner of the channel , "Chris", attempts to critically analysie
the psychological, metaphysical, and symbolic meanings of certain "memes"
Using the works of such as C.G Jung, F.Neitschze, A.Crowley, And W.Reich.
I dont agree with some of the individualls above, and sometimes find their
collective works as absolutley nonsenical at times, but at other times, they
manage to pass on a good idea or two.</p>
<h1>Lifestyle influences</h1>
<p>One of my main lifestyle influences over the past year has been an individual
known online as <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz">Luke Smith.</a>
To give you the basics, hes a proponent of minimalism, the linux operating system,
Being independant, Being anti consumerist, rejecting modern "degenerate" ideas
(the term degenerate has a specific definition here, to get the right idea,
please visit his website and "consume" some of his content)
Infact, if it werent for Luke, I wouldnt have this website, and even if I did,
it wouldnt look this way.
</p>
<h1>Programming influences</h1>
<p>My biggest programming influencer would probably have to be an individual
known online as <a href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/">GeoHot</a>
He was once well known for being the first person to "JailBreak" the first
iPhone, A term which he coined himself with his friends I belive(he was 17 at the time.)
He later went on to literally create his own version of teslas autopilot,
which he dubbed <a href="https://comma.ai">commai.ai</a> with the aim
of being the "Android" of self driving vehicles.
His outlook on life as a young entrepenuer, his incredible amount of intelligence
karisma, and other aspects & outlooks on life, make him an online figure i truly
enjoy listening to. At one point he even began to influence my music taste,
which led me to discover an artist I still listen to to this day, known as
<a href"https://www.youtube.com/user/gwatsky">Watsky</a></p>
